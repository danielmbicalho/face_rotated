# face_rotated
A CNN to correct the images rotated

First experience with CNN, where the model recieve images of face rotated and their labels and do goal is put the 
images on a right orientation. 

## Metodology

As the first approach was used a 2 convolutional layers to extract the information. 
The filter was empirical, the small size was used due the image size.
